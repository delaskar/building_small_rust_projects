# Getting Started

To use Compress Shattered, clone the repository:

`git clone git clone https://github.com/delaskar/the-compress-shattered.git`

Make sure you have Rust installed on your machine. If not, install it from the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

To run Compress Shattered, navigate to the cloned repository and run:

`cargo run
`

This will compile and run the code.

## Usage
The program will ask for the name of the file you want to compress. After entering the name, the program will compress the file and add "_file_compressed" to the filename.

You will then be prompted to choose whether you want to decompress the file or not. If you enter "y", the program will prompt you to enter the name of the file you want to decompress. It will then create a new file called "Decompressed_File" and write the decompressed contents to it.
