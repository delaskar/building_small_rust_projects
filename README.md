# Building Small Rust Projects
This repository is a collection of small Rust projects that are designed to help you learn the Rust programming language. Each project is self-contained and can be built and run independently.

### Requirements
To build and run these projects, you need to have Rust installed on your system. You can download and install Rust from the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

## Projects
Here are the projects included in this repository:

1. ### Zodiac Signs Program:
    This is a simple program that helps you determine your zodiac sign based on your birth date.

2. ### Data Users Program
    This is a program that collects data from users through a series of questions and saves the responses to a file. The project includes basic input/output functionality and data structuring.

3. ### The Compress Shattered
    Compress Shattered is a simple Rust command-line tool for compressing files with the zlib library.

4. ### Flappy Dragon
    This is a simple implementation of the Flappy Dragon game, created using the Rust programming language and the "Hands on Rust" book.

### How to Build and Run
To build and run a project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

cargo run

This will build and run the project.
