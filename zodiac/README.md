### Zodiac Signs Program
This is a simple program written in Rust that helps you determine your zodiac sign based on your birth date. It prompts the user to enter their name, birth month, and birth day, and then uses a matching expression to determine their zodiac sign.

## How to Use
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Install Rust programming language: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
Navigate to the project directory: cd your-repo
Run the program: cargo run
Follow the prompts to enter your name, birth month, and birth day.
The program will output your zodiac sign.

## How it Works
The program uses a function to prompt the user for input, then creates a vector of zodiac signs. It then enters a loop that asks the user for their name, birth month, and birth day. It converts the birth month and day from a string to an integer, and then uses a matching expression to determine the user's zodiac sign based on their birth date. The program then outputs the user's zodiac sign and asks if they want to see another zodiac sign. If the user enters 'y', the program loops again. If the user enters 'n', the program exits.
